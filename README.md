# reword.nvim
A lightweight Neovim plugin to quickly find and swap synonyms while writing - without ever leaving Neovim.

## Requirements
- Neovim `0.8+`
- Internet connection (for now - local caching coming)

## Installation
Just like any other plugin. 

Example using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
```lua
{ 'martincornelius/reword.nvim' }
```

## Usage
For now, hover over a word in Neovim and press `<leader>rw` to bring up synonyms.


## Acknowledgments
This plugin uses the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) to fetch synonyms and related words.
